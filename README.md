# Digital Computer Systems University Exercises

This repository contains the exercises completed as part of the **"Digital Computer Systems"** course at Technical University of Crete. The course material is divided into **five exercises**, focusing on the design and implementation of sequential circuits, finite state machines, and assembly language programming.

## ðŸ“š Exercises Overview

This repository is structured into **five exercises**, covering both hardware design using VHDL and low-level programming in assembly language. Below is a summary of the topics explored in each exercise:

### **Exercise 1: Behavioral Design of Sequential Circuits (VHDL)**
- Design and simulation of sequential circuits using VHDL.
- Focus on behavioral modeling of flip-flops, registers, and counters.

### **Exercise 2: Implementation of a Finite State Machine (VHDL)**
- Design and implementation of finite state machines (FSMs) in VHDL.
- Applications include control units and state-based systems.

### **Exercise 3: Simple Loops and Symbol Processing (Assembly)**
- Implementation of basic loops and character/string processing in assembly language.
- Introduction to assembly programming and debugging.

### **Exercise 4: Subroutines, Argument Passing, Word-Level Processing, and Structured Code (Assembly)**
- Development of modular code using subroutines.
- Techniques for passing arguments and returning results.
- Word-level data processing and structured programming practices.

### **Exercise 5: Nested Procedures, Memory Access with Offset, Struct Implementation, and Simple Stack Management (Assembly)**
- Advanced assembly programming with nested procedures.
- Memory access using offsets for implementing data structures (e.g., structs).
- Stack management for function calls and local variables.
